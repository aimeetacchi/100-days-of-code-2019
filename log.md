### Day 15: Wed - May 1, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I'm still fighting with trying to do this update todo. I think my state is all wrong.. Idk.. My state is an array and when u add a new todo it adds a new object to the array that has an item, id, completed, editing... So how do I go about editing the text of the clicked item.. Then updating the objects item in the state.. Hmmm any help would be appreciated.
